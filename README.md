## Summer School in Computational Biology @ UC 

*Modelling prostate cancer growth using a phase-field model.*

**Research team**: Oliver, Hygor, Diana, Carlos, Milan, Mauricio & Rui.

## Files:
- src/main.py - full numpy/scipy implementation

## Logbook

### 1st day:
- Laplace Operator;
- Euler's Method for time integration;
- Presented and implemented the phase-field basic model.

### 2nd day:
- Implemented the complete model including the nutrient field.

### 3rd day:
- Search for the right set of parameters in order to reproduce the paper results.
